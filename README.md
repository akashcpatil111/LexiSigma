# LexiSigma Editor

A modular React Rich Text Editor built with Vite, Lexical, and TypeScript. It features text formatting, native tables, and an interactive KaTeX Math plugin for LaTeX. Zustand manages UI state efficiently, while a debounced JSON serialization system ensures robust autosave persistence to local storage without affecting editor performance.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Decoupled editor core with separate plugins for rendering, persistence, and specialized node handling.
- **Robust State Management**: Utilizes Zustand to bridge Editor UI signals (like formatting active states) safely out of Lexical bounds, while limiting complex mirroring to a serialized JSON output.
- **KaTeX / Editable Math**: Includes a custom `MathNode` plugin that renders intricate mathematical notation in real-time, resolving to an input field upon click for precise inline editing.
- **Native Table Support**: Grid table structures fully integrated with Lexical's native `@lexical/table`.
- **LocalStorage Data Persistence**: Background saving with a 1-second debounce to minimize disruption to user typing speed.
- **Modern Styled UI**: Built on top of Tailwind CSS V4 for a responsive and clean user interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React (Vite / TypeScript)
- **Editor**: Lexical & `@lexical/react`
- **Global State**: Zustand
- **Math Engine**: KaTeX
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / Lucide React
